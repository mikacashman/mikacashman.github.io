# About me

Welcome to my personal website. I'm a research software engineer interested in computaional biology acting as an interpreter between computer science and the biological sciences.  

Currently a research software engineer at Berkeley Lab in the Environmental Genomics and Systems Biology division of Biosciences. Working on the Department of Energy Systems Biology 
Knowledgebase (KBase) project on research and development.  I build and manage the computational infrastucture behind large-scale analyses of microbial genomics.  My work extends from 
data acquisition (cleaning, harmonizing), enabling high-throughput experiements on HPC systems, custom pipelines, and scaable workflows.  Currently I support a global study of pangenomes 
to explore how gene content related to microbial species boundaries, evolution, and ecologica adptation. 

Completed a postdoctoral position at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the Biosciences Division working in the Computational and Predictive Biology group with Dr. Dan Jacobson. At ORNL my 
focus was on high-performance computing (exascale) for biology and high-throughput phenotype studies.  Projects included global-scale climate clustering and analysis, GPU workflows, 
explainable machine learning, and integration of multi-omics data through network analysis as I collaborate with CBI, PMI, KBase, Berkeley Labs, and more.

Graduated in 2020 with a PhD in Computer Science from Iowa State University under the advisement of Dr. Myra Cohen.  PhD research on providing interpretable solutions to configurable 
software in the biosciences though software engineering methodologies.  Technical areas of interest include: software testing (combinatorial interaction testing), machine learning (classification), and systems biology.

Completed my Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln working in the ESQuaRed lab for Empirically Based Software Quality Research under the advisement 
of Dr. Myra Cohen.  Worked in an interdisciplinary group bringing together software engineering, networking, synthetic biology, biochemistry, and mathematics.
